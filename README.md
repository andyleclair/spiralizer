# Spiralizer

A small utility to Spiralize a two-dimensional array

## Note:

This approach is considerably different than what I achieved during the on-camera challenge.

I took a brief break (no cheating, I promise!) and thought about the underlying data structure and what I could do to work with the data instead of trying to work against it.

I've provided the original implementation in `spiralizer_old.ex` if you'd like to see the somewhat working (on the given input, but not the general case) idea. It's not in the `lib` directory, so it won't get compiled.

This algorithm does work in the general case, please see the tests (or just run `mix test`)
